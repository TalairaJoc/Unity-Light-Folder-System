# Unity-Light-Folder-System

As my Unity Game Porject grew, I wanted a system to make folder in my Hierarchy so I could organize my scenes.

I looked a little on the internet and found one good solution but it ain't free : https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/hierarchy-folders-157716

I also found some free solutions but it looked overkilled for just organize my scene hierarchy : https://github.com/xsduan/unity-hierarchy-folders 

So I made my own System consisting of only one cs file. 

Installation and How to use :

Just copy past the file
